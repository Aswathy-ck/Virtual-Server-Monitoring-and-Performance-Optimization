# Virtual-Server-Monitoring-and-Performance-Optimization
Problem Statement: XYZ Corporation, a global enterprise, operates a distributed cloud infrastructure comprising numerous virtual servers that host business-critical applications. However, the organization faces challenges in effectively monitoring server performance, detecting anomalies, and proactively managing resource utilization. Real-time insights into server health and availability are limited due to the lack of a robust data engineering pipeline.

To improve operational efficiency and prevent downtime, XYZ Corporation aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests, processes, and visualizes server performance data. This pipeline will enable proactive issue resolution, optimized resource utilization, and enhanced server performance management.

Data Description:
Teams are provided with an Excel file containing the following sheets:
1.	Server_Metadata: Contains 100 records detailing server configurations, cluster assignments, and administrator contact details.
2.	Server_Performance_Station1: Contains 3,000 records of performance logs captured from Station 1. 
It includes additional fields such as Config_Version, Last_Patch_Date, and Deployment_Token which are not relevant for visualization.
3.	Server_Performance_Station2: Contains 2,000 records of performance logs captured from Station 2. 
Both performance datasets include intentional null values.
